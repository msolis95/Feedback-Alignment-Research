# Feedback-Alignment-Research
This code was written in August-September 2023 for my research at Caltech under Andrew Stuart with Samuel Lanthaler as my co-mentor. Over the course of eight weeks, the goal of my research was to investigate the efficacy of feedback alignment in comparison to traditional backpropagation. I tested the three types of feedback alignment outlined in _Direct Feedback Alignment Provides Learning in Deep Neural Networks_ by Arild NÃ¸kland (2016) using the online image dataset MNIST.
